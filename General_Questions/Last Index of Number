//Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the last index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array. Last index means - if x is present multiple times in the array, return the index at which x comes last in the array. You should start traversing your array from 0, not from (N - 1).

int lastIndex(int input[], int size, int x) {
    if(size==0) return -1;
    int f = lastIndex(input+1,size-1,x);
    if(f==-1){
        if(input[0]==x){
            return 0;
        }else{
            return -1;
        }
    } 
    else return f+1;
}
